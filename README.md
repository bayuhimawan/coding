**NOTE:**
This repository is used for the the upcoming and experimental **Coding with Chrome Suite** version.

If you are looking for the **Chrome App** version from the Chrome Store, please use [chrome-app-v6.x repository][1] instead.

**Coding with Chrome Suite** is an Educational Coding Development Environment built
around two core philosophies:

1. Offer a stand-alone, offline app experience which allows people anywhere to
   learn how to build useful computer programs:
   - A basic OS allow the access to different external devices like robots
   - A basic IDE able to support real programming work
   - A tutorial system that poses a challenge, checks the solution and
     provides feedback.
2. Allow educators to put together a custom curriculum made up of various
   components like:
   - Input languages (blockly, javascript)
   - Output modules (turtle graphics, javascript output, connected robots)
   - Flexible UI where elements can be easily added, modified or removed
   - Tutorial engine for self-learning
